## Description
Application in NestJS that caches DB records with multiple fields in Redis for fast searching. The search feature enables fuzzy searches across fields, using restaurant data as an example. A search query may contain the restaurant name or its partial location. The cache is invalidated when any record is updated or a new restaurant is added to the database. The search results are always consistent with the actual database query.
